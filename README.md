Here's a suggested README for that Twitter-like REST API:

# Twitter API

This is a REST API for a Twitter-like social media service. It provides resources and endpoints to manage users, tweets, follows, and more.

## Resources

- Users: Represents user profiles with attributes like name, username, bio, location, etc.
- Tweets: Represents tweets with attributes like content, timestamp, likes, etc.
- Follows: Represents follower/following relationships between users.

## Endpoints

- GET /users: Get a list of all users. Can filter by username, location, etc.
- GET /users/{id}: Get details of a single user by id.
- POST /users: Create a new user. Accepts name, username, password, etc. Returns created user.
- PUT /users/{id}: Update details of an existing user.

- GET /tweets: Get a list of tweets. Can filter by user, hashtag, date, etc.
- GET /tweets/{id}: Get a single tweet by id.
- POST /tweets: Create a new tweet. Accepts content, location, user id, etc. Returns created tweet.

- GET /search: Search for tweets by content, hashtags, usernames, etc.

## Additional Features

- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Pagination for endpoints that return lists
- Versioning in the URL (e.g. /v1/users) in case the API changes
- Swagger documentation
- Unit and integration tests
- CI/CD pipeline to build, test and deploy the API
